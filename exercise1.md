My choice of language for the application would be Java because it’s the language I’ve used the most.

For linting, I’d combine the built-in tools in any proper IDE, e.g., IntelliJ, and Checkstyle. With Checkstyle, I could enforce specific custom rules easily, opt-out various parts of the code from linting and examine statistics in the linting report generated by Checkstyle. Built-in tools in IDEs tend to be pretty good with Java with even code suggestions included. Other options for linting could be PMD, Uncrustify and Lightrun. Although it seems Lightrun isn’t actually a linter, but more of a runtime debugger. It would be interesting to see if it could increase our team’s workflow (if at all).

A quick Google search showed up alternatives for Jenkins and GitHub Actions for setting up CI for Java; TeamCity by JetBrains, Travis Ci, Azure DevOps and CircleCI to name a few.

I’d probably use cloud-based server for this project. I’ve never set up a CI server before and I don’t think I’ll need the flexibility and the customizability any self-hosted CI server offers if the application we’re developing is not too complicated. Although it would be nice to try out Jenkins with this project since it’s so popular. It would probably benefit everyone in my team to know how to set up CI server with Jenkins.
